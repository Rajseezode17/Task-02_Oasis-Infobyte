        <p>Isaac Newton, in full Sir Isaac Newton, (born December 25, 1642 [January
        4, 1643, New Style], Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England—died March 20
        [March 31], 1727, London), English physicist and mathematician, who was
        the culminating figure of the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century.
        In optics, his discovery of the composition of white light integrated
        the phenomena of colours into the science of light and laid the
        foundation for modern physical optics. In mechanics, his three laws of
        motion, the basic principles of modern physics, resulted in the
        formulation of the law of universal gravitation. In mathematics, he was
        the original discoverer of the infinitesimal calculus. Newton’s
        Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of
        Natural Philosophy, 1687) was one of the most important single works in
        the history of modern science. Born in the hamlet of Woolsthorpe, Newton
        was the only son of a local yeoman, also Isaac Newton, who had died
        three months before, and of Hannah Ayscough. That same year, at Arcetri
        near Florence, Galileo Galilei had died; Newton would eventually pick up
        his idea of a mathematical science of motion and bring his work to full
        fruition.

                A tiny and weak baby, Newton was not expected to survive his
        first day of life, much less 84 years. Deprived of a father before
        birth, he soon lost his mother as well, for within two years she married
        a second time; her husband, the well-to-do minister Barnabas Smith, left
        young Isaac with his grandmother and moved to a neighbouring village to
        raise a son and two daughters. For nine years, until the death of
        Barnabas Smith in 1653, Isaac was effectively separated from his mother,
        and his pronounced psychotic tendencies have been ascribed to this
        traumatic event. That he hated his stepfather we may be sure. When he
        examined the state of his soul in 1662 and compiled a catalog of sins in
        shorthand, he remembered “Threatning my father and mother Smith to burne
        them and the house over them.” The acute sense of insecurity that
        rendered him obsessively anxious when his work was published and
        irrationally violent when he defended it accompanied Newton throughout
        his life and can plausibly be traced to his early years.</p>

          <h2>Most Famous Discoveries</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Newton’s three laws of motion set the foundation for modern classical mechanics.</li>
              <li>His discovery of the gravitational force gave man the ability to predict movements of celestial objects, 
                  while simultaneously validating Kepler’s laws and the heliocentric Copernican model of the solar system.</li>
              <li>His co-discovery of calculus provided a potent mathematical tool, aiding the precise analytical treatment of the physical world.</li>
              <p>One of Newton's most notable achievements was his formulation of the laws of motion and universal gravitation. Published in his renowned work 
                "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica" in 1687, these laws laid the foundation for classical mechanics. They provided a mathematical 
                framework to understand the motion of objects and the force of gravity, revolutionizing the field of physics.</p><br>
                <p>In addition to his work on mechanics, Newton made significant contributions to optics, studying the behavior of light and developing the theory of color. 
                    He conducted experiments with prisms and proposed that white light consists of a spectrum of colors.Newton's scientific accomplishments brought him 
                    recognition and accolades. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1672 and served as its president from 1703 to 1727. In 1705, he was knighted 
                    by Queen Anne for his services to science.Sir Isaac Newton's legacy is profound and enduring. His theories and laws have shaped our understanding of the 
                    physical world and laid the groundwork for future scientific advancements. He is celebrated as one of the greatest scientific minds in history, and 
                    his contributions continue to inspire scientists and scholars to this day. Newton passed away on March 20, 1727, leaving behind a remarkable 
                    legacy that forever changed the course of science.</p>

        <h2>Newton’s Discoveries</h2>
        <p>Isaac Newton’s discoveries gave physics its theoretical foundation,
        granted powerful tools to mathematics and created a launch pad for
        future developments in science. I do not know what I may appear to the
        world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the
        sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother
        pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of
        truth lay all undiscovered before me. – Sir Isaac Newton This thought
        offers a rare insight into the workings of great minds like Newton. An
        inherent curiosity about the world, an appreciation of beauty, the
        excitement of exploring a mystery and a relentless pursuit of truth are
        the prime driving forces of a creative mind. One of the greatest
        scientists of all time, Sir Isaac Newton’s discoveries led to a deeper
        understanding of nature and gave physics (known as Natural Philosophy in
        his time) a firm physical and mathematical foundation.<br>
        <p>                                                   </p><br>
        Besides his work on universal gravitation (gravity), Newton developed the 
        three laws of motion which form the basic principles of modern physics. 
        His discovery of calculus led the way to more powerful methods of solving 
        mathematical problems. His work in optics included the study of white light 
        and the discovery of the color spectrum. It was his experiments with light 
        that first made him famous.</p>
